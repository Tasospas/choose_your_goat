          <p>
            Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New
            York City, on February 17, 1963,[28] the son of bank employee
            Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan
            Sr.[28][29] In 1968, he moved with his family to Wilmington, North
            Carolina.[30] Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in
            Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing
            basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball
            varsity team during his sophomore year; at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80
            m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend
            Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team

          <p>
            As a freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for
            the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[20] The Fighting
            Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making
            them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season
            undefeated.[21] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2
            rebounds, along with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game.[22] For
            some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at
            the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket
            demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who
            wanted to see James play.[23] The Fighting Irish finished the season
            26–1 and repeated as state champions.[20] For his outstanding play,
            James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today
            All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[20]

              It's a fact that Michael Jordan managed to win the most titles

              more Finals MVP while at the same time putting up the best numbers

              He became a global icon and managed to make the game of basketball

              Even now at 38 years old LeBron remains one of the best 5 players
              in the world. He's been the epitomy of consistency while carrying
              subpar teams to the Finals. His stats are out of thIS world and
              not only he's won a lot of awards, he's managed to do it with 3
              different teams. By the end of his career he'll be the top scorer
              of NBA history, while being viewed as a pass first guy. He's on
              track to finish his careed with 40k points, 10k assists and 10k
              rebounds. Personally i view LeBron as the GOAT!
